Made in Apache NetBeans. No database required. No data structures.

(o) Priority of Operands:
	* and /   --> highest
	% 	  --> mid
	+ and -   -->lowest

(o) Keyboard Keys:
	0-9  		--> numbers
	+-*/%		--> operands
	.    		--> decimal(point)
	Backspace	--> Backspace (<--)
	Enter		--> Ans (=)
	Esc  		--> Clc (clear)
Note:- Turning the Calculator ON/OFF is done by the button present on the screen only.

(o) Advancements:

--> Work with decimal system (points)
--> Good looking simplistic design and programming.
--> Calculates modulus of numbers ( % )
--> Has all the basic features like back(<--), clear(Clc), Ans(=). Also the ON/OFF button.
--> Can also be accessed by Keyboard Keys.


(o) Difficulties:

--> Display is small to display huge numbers (hint: setting up max limit)
--> Cannot scroll back and forth to check the numbers being entered are correct or not (if one entering mistake user has keep on going back till the error)
--> The mathematical engine ("Nashorn engine is planned to be removed from a future JDK release") 
--> History is not maintained.
